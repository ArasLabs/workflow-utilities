# Workflow Utilities

* New version 3-0. This Add-On Package adds functionality to complement the standard workflows features (see Reame.txt for details)

* Toolbar button of Workflow History Form to view the Workflow Process directly from the "SignOffs" tab.

* Logic to use placeholder identities on WF activities that get resolved according to configurable rules.

* Logic to change WF Activitiesâ€™ permissions to allow "adhoc" Workflow Assignments.

* A "single Review Express DCO Workflow" and "Express Team DCO Workflow" that can be used instead of the standard workflow.

* Sample code to show how to save data from Workflow activities to the item connected to the workflow process.

* Logic to "clone" an activity when you loop to it again so you can still add different "ad-hoc" assignments. The "Team Review Express DCO" workflow has an example how to use this logic.

* A separate package with a custom(sample) Workflow using WF Utilities to show how to programmatically instantiate a workflow.
